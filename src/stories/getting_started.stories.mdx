# Zen UI

## General notes

Notes here apply to all components from Zen UI library.
Read this before consuming these components.

### Events

By default, all Zen-UI components emit **prefixed custom events** instead of native ones.<br/>
So if you want to listen to changes/focus/... hook on to:

`zenChange`
`zenInput`
`zenFocus`
`zenBlur`
