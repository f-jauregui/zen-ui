# ZenUI

[A collection of UI components](https://zen-ui.zengrc.com/) that are shared across Reciprocity applications.

Powered by [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Installation

Before installing, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) is recommended.

It is not necessary to have Docker installed as the project is not containerized.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

Start Stencil compiler and Storybook server (available at `http://localhost:6006`):
```bash
# Runs both in watch mode with HMR
yarn start
```

#### Create new Web Components

Scaffolds a new component, creating the folder structure with basic code, styles, unit tests, and documentation:
```bash
yarn create:component zen-{component-name}
```

#### Linting and Formatting
Both `lint` and `format` commands will run before the changes are pushed to the repository using a [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-push hook.

```bash
# Checks and fixes linting errors
yarn lint
# Only checks for linting errors
yarn lint:check
```

```bash
# Checks and fixes formatting errors
yarn format
# Only checks for formatting errors
yarn format:check
```


## Folder structure
`src/components` Stencil src folder. Implementation, tests, and stories for each component.\
`src/stories` General stories/guides, not based on an individual Zen UI component.\
`.storybook` Storybook configuration files.\
`.circleci` Deployment configuration.\
`.husky` Pre-Commit and Pre-Push hooks (linters, format, tests).

## How it works?

#### Stencil
The library is based on [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction). Stencil is a compiler to produce **Standard Web Components**.

#### Web components
Web Components are part of the existing Web Standards. Thus they're natively supported by modern web browsers (IE with polyfills).\
Therefore they can be consumed in any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular,...) or even in vanilla JS.

#### Storybook
For presentation, we're using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).\
Storybook is an industry-standard for presenting component libraries and design styles.

## Internal documentation

#### Components documentation
Documentation for each component is autogenerated by Stencil. Storybook picks autogenerated `readme.md` of each component and includes it to component's story.\
Check [Stencil Docs Readme generation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-readme) for detailed guides on how to tailor docs using special code comments.

## MDX
All pages/stories are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/). MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents.\
Be sure to get to know it better before altering docs.

## VSCode extensions
To enable highlighting of html inside lit-html tags (html\`...\`), you can use extension [Comment tagged templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.comment-tagged-templates) or [lit-plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin).


## Components guidelines
### Components should behave as default html components
When building components keep in mind, that it should behave the same way as default html components.
It means if you have a working default html component, you should only change tag name into zen component and eveything will still work as expected. Eg:

```html
<select name="cars" id="cars" @change="myFunction()">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
```

can be changed into zen component by just prepending tag names with `zen-` and
also prepending native events with `zen`:

```html
<zen-select name="cars" id="cars" @zenChange="myFunction()">
  <zen-option value="volvo">Volvo</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="saab">Saab</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="mercedes">Mercedes</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="audi">Audi</zen-option>
</zen-select>
```

### Emit default events
Emit default events (`click`, `change`, `input`,...) instead making them up
