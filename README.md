# ZenUI
[A collection of UI components](https://zen-ui.zengrc.com/) that are shared across Reciprocity applications.\
Powered by StencilJS and Storybook.

## Dev environment setup
#### Install all required dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

#### Initial build and run of both Stencil and Storybook in watch mode with HMR
```
yarn start
```
###### Storybook should be available on `http://localhost:6006`.

#### To create new Web Components
```bash
yarn create:component zen-{component-name}
```
###### This will automatically create folder structure for the component, it's internal basic tests, style and documentation along with a basic code structure.

#### To lint-check code
```bash
yarn check:lint
```

#### To format styles with Prettier
```bash
yarn check:format
```
###### Both previous commands will ran before the changes are pushed to the repository. (Husky's Pre-Push Hook)

## How to consume the library
#### Install it
```js
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from '@reciprocity/zen-ui/loader';

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements();
});
```

#### Import all components
```bash
yarn add @reciprocity/zen-ui
```

#### Import components one at a time
```js
import { ZenButton, ZenSpinner } from '@reciprocity/zen-ui/dist/custom-elements';

customElements.define('zen-button', ZenButton);
customElements.define('zen-spinner', ZenSpinner);
```

## Folder structure
`src/components` Stencil src folder. Implementation, tests, and stories for all available Zen UI components.\
`src/stories` General stories/guides, not based on an individual Zen UI component.\
`.storybook` Storybook configuration files.\
`.circleci` Deployment configuration.\
`.husky` Pre-Commit and Pre-Push hooks (linters, format, tests).

## How it works?

#### Stencil
The library is based on [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction). Stencil is a compiler to produce **Standard Web Components**.

#### Web components
Web Components are part of the existing Web Standards. Thus they're natively supported by modern web browsers (IE with polyfills).\
Therefore they can be consumed in any frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular,...) or even in vanilla JS.

#### Storybook
For presentation, we're using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).\
Storybook is an industry-standard for presenting component libraries and design styles.

## Internal documentation

#### Components documentation
Documentation for each component is autogenerated by Stencil. Storybook picks autogenerated `readme.md` of each component and includes it to component's story.\
Check [Stencil Docs Readme generation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-readme) for detailed guides on how to tailor docs using special code comments.

#### MDX
All non-component pages are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/). MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents.\
Be sure to get to know it better before altering docs.
