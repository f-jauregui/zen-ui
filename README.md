# ZEN-UI
*A collection of UI components that are shared across Reciprocity applications*

## Dev environment setup
`yarn`
`yarn start` This command will concurrently run both Stencil and Storybook in watch mode.
Storybook should be available on `http://localhost:6006`
Changes on components are shown in Storybook in real-time (hot module reload)

## Folder structure
`src/components` Stencil src folder. Implementation, tests, and stories for all available Zen UI components.
`src/stories` General stories/guides, not based on an individual Zen UI component
`.storybook` Storybook configuration files
`.circleci` Deployment configuration

## How it works

### Stencil
The library is based on [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction). Stencil is a lib to produce standard **web components**.

### Web components
Web components are part of the existing Web standards. Thus they're natively supported by modern web browsers (IE with polyfills). Therefore they can be consumed in any FE framework (React, Vue, Angular,...) or even in Vanilla js.

### Storybook
For presentation, we're using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Storybook is an industry-standard for presenting component libraries and design styles.

[ZenUI Storybook](https://zen-ui.zengrc.com/)

Stencil support is under development since March 2019 (1.5 years since this writing), but there's nothing public yet.
Therefore this lib is based on Storybook config for web components. Setup was created from the ground up but was modeled on [dutscher/stencil-storybook](https://github.com/dutscher/stencil-storybook).
Under the hood, it uses **lit-html** for rendering the components. This is why the components in each story are implemented using lit-html. Lit-html allows us to use some powerful stuff that is common for higher FE frameworks, like binding non-scalar props (arrays, objects) directly and listening to emitted events.

## Dev environment

### Components documentation
Documentation for each component is autogenerated by Stencil. Storybook picks autogenerated `readme.md` of each component and includes it to component's story. Check [Stencil Docs Readme generation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-readme) for detailed guides on how to tailor docs using special code comments.

## MDX
All non-component pages are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/). MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents. Be sure to get to know it better before altering docs.
