# ZenUI

[A collection of UI components](https://zen-ui.zengrc.com/) that are shared across Reciprocity applications.

Powered by [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Installation

Before installing, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Latest [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) is recommended.

It is not necessary to have Docker installed as the project is not containerized.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

Start Stencil compiler and Storybook server (available at `http://localhost:6006`):
```bash
# Runs both in watch mode with HMR
yarn start
```

#### Create new Web Components

Scaffolds a new component, creating the folder structure with basic code, styles, unit tests, and documentation:
```bash
yarn create:component zen-{component-name}
```

#### Testing
```bash
yarn test
```

#### Linting and Formatting
Both `lint` and `format` commands will run before the changes are pushed to the repository using a [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-push hook.

```bash
# Checks and fixes linting errors
yarn lint
# Only checks for linting errors
yarn lint:check
```

```bash
# Checks and fixes formatting errors
yarn format
# Only checks for formatting errors
yarn format:check
```



## Internal documentation

#### Components documentation
Documentation for each component is autogenerated by Stencil. Storybook picks autogenerated `readme.md` of each component and includes it to component's story.\
Check [Stencil Docs Readme generation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-readme) for detailed guides on how to tailor docs using special code comments.

## MDX
All pages/stories are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/). MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents.\
Be sure to get to know it better before altering docs.

## VSCode extensions
To enable highlighting of html inside lit-html tags (html\`...\`), you can use extension [Comment tagged templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.comment-tagged-templates) or [lit-plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=runem.lit-plugin).


## Components guidelines
### Components should behave as default html components
When building components keep in mind, that it should behave the same way as default html components.
It means if you have a working default html component, you should only change tag name into zen component and eveything will still work as expected. Eg:

```html
<select name="cars" id="cars" @change="myFunction()">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>
```

can be changed into zen component by just prepending tag names with `zen-` and
also prepending native events with `zen`:

```html
<zen-select name="cars" id="cars" @zenChange="myFunction()">
  <zen-option value="volvo">Volvo</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="saab">Saab</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="mercedes">Mercedes</zen-option>
  <zen-option value="audi">Audi</zen-option>
</zen-select>
```

### Emit default events
Emit default events (`click`, `change`, `input`,...) instead making them up
