# Changelog

## Upcoming in the next release:

#### Breaking changes

1. `padding` and `spacing` value `xl` was changed from `2rem` to `1.5rem`. New prop value `2xl` was added that equals `2rem`. So to keep the same padding, replace `padding="xl"` with `padding="2xl"`
2. `zen-card` - Default padding set to 1 rem
3. `zen-tooltip` - Slot `content` removed. Added prop `padding` to be able to control padding.
4. `zen-option` - Prop `defaultPadding` removed. Added prop `padding` to be able to control padding.
